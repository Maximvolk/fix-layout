# Fix keyboard layout typos.

This script takes data from clipboard, determines its language and changes keyboard layout for that data.
Thus you are able to change keyboard layout postfactum.

### Examples:
<i>ghjuhfvvbhjdfybt -> программирование</i>  
<i>ПшеРги -> GitHub</i>  

It works only for english and russian layouts.  

### Compatible with:
1. Linux (tested on kUbuntu 18)
2. Mac OS

### P.S.  
This script could have been done more easily using clipboard python library. Program is based on terminal commands to avoid problems with dependencies (for easy binding to a keyboard shortcut).
